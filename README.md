# Clicker Heroes Access Patcher

*Code written by Claude 4.6 Opus (Max subscription).*

A standalone installer for the [Clicker Heroes Access](https://github.com/ShotgunSpoon/ch_access) mod, which adds screen reader accessibility to [Clicker Heroes](https://store.steampowered.com/app/363970/Clicker_Heroes/) on Steam.

## Download

Download **ClickerHeroesAccessPatcher.exe** from the [latest release](https://github.com/ShotgunSpoon/ch_patcher/releases/latest).

## How to Use

1. Run **ClickerHeroesAccessPatcher.exe**.
2. It will ask for your Clicker Heroes install folder. The default is:
   ```
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Clicker Heroes
   ```
   If your game is installed somewhere else, paste the correct path or click **Browse for Folder** to find it.
3. Click **Patch Clicker Heroes**.
4. The patcher will:
   - Check if MelonLoader is installed. If not, it downloads and opens the MelonLoader installer — follow its prompts, then close it.
   - Download the latest **ClickerHeroesAccess.dll** from GitHub.
   - Place the DLL in the game's **Mods** folder.
5. Launch Clicker Heroes through Steam. The mod will load automatically.

## Finding Your Install Folder

If you're not sure where Clicker Heroes is installed:

1. Open **Steam**.
2. Go to your **Library**.
3. Right-click **Clicker Heroes** and select **Properties**.
4. Click the **Installed Files** tab.
5. Click **Browse**.
6. This opens the game's install folder. Copy the path from the address bar and paste it into the patcher.

The default Steam install path is:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Clicker Heroes
```
